# BlazorTicTacToe
Basic game against computer or another player.

Computer logic is in Data/Computer.cs

Looking back at this code and it's pretty bad. There's no reason to manually enter the gametable but to use foreach or for loops instead (I did this in my game of life project) 

But it is what it is and it works and there's really no reason for me to make it better.. but lessons learned.
